# FlusterIO

> This app is currently under construction. Please check back in June.

FlusterIO came to be when a dude with a background in physics and astrophysics decided to leave his career in software to tackle a modified model of relativity that has shown somewhat unprecidented promise (general relativity is comparable) to this point. After this dude (me, writing in the third person of course) became frustrated with existing note taking options he build his own, which grew to accomodate almost the entire workflow of a modern student or academic. After 3 years of modifying an existing web app, the application was abandoned and rebuilt from the ground up with Flutter and Rust. All of the features that were present in the web app are planned for the native Flutter application, but this native interface opens the door to far more. This rebuild with Flutter gives a beautiful, performant UI and user experience, but an even more performant interface with Rust when the application needs to do any heavy calculations.
